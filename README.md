# Farm To Fork Traceability Of Farm Products

## Overview

* By storing every Farmerâ€™s information in form of ID from every bulk of a crop, then after generation that lot ID, storing it in form of QR code and attaching this QR code on every final product may help to trace the origin of the food.
* We will provide an app for user to register and login, where  user can store information about the farmer, his Products, The location where the product is grown and all other crop details, also from whom the user has purchased the crops. From this info, unique ID of that farmer will be generated on this products. 
* This ID will then carried on with the bulk amount of products to the industry, then a QR code will be generated from lot ID which will be printed on food product, eventually to the Distributer, then forwarded by Retailer and finally to the consumer.
